# NutriSense: Your AI-Powered Holistic Nutrition Companion

## Project Purpose

NutriSense is a cutting-edge mobile application designed to revolutionize calorie and nutrient tracking. It goes beyond basic macro counting to provide comprehensive micronutrient analysis, AI-driven personalized insights into how diet impacts overall well-being (energy levels, mood, gut health), proactive alerts for nutrient deficiencies or excesses, a novel 'food quality' score, and integrated correlations between dietary intake and lifestyle factors. NutriSense aims to bridge the gap between extensive food logging and actionable, personalized health advice, empowering users to truly understand and optimize their nutrition for holistic health.

## Market Gap Analysis & Technology Stack Alignment

NutriSense directly addresses critical gaps and unmet customer needs in the current nutrition tracking market:

*   **Deep Micronutrient & Holistic Impact:** Competitors like MyFitnessPal and Lose It! offer basic calorie and macronutrient tracking, but often lack depth in micronutrient analysis and fail to connect dietary intake to specific well-being indicators like mood or energy. Cronometer excels at micronutrients but can be less intuitive and its advanced features are premium-gated. NutriSense's core value proposition – understanding the *full* nutritional impact and its link to holistic health – is met by our technology choices.
*   **AI-Driven Personalized Insights & Accuracy:** Users are frustrated with data inaccuracy and desire actionable advice. Our choice of **Python** as the backend language, coupled with libraries like **TensorFlow/PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy**, is paramount. This robust AI/ML ecosystem allows us to develop sophisticated models for:
    *   Generating personalized insights linking diet to energy, mood, and gut health.
    *   Calculating a nuanced 'food quality' score, combating processed food bias.
    *   Implementing proactive deficiency/excess alerts based on individual needs and intake patterns.
    *   Identifying complex food and lifestyle correlations.
*   **Scalability and Performance for Data-Rich Features:** The sheer volume and complexity of nutrient data, user logs, and AI-generated insights require a scalable and performant infrastructure.
    *   **FastAPI (Python)** provides a high-performance, asynchronous backend framework capable of handling complex data processing and serving AI model outputs efficiently.
    *   **PostgreSQL** is chosen for its reliability, data integrity, and advanced querying capabilities. It can store our extensive food database, detailed user logs, and micronutrient profiles. Its support for JSONB and potential extensions like `pgvector` ensures flexibility for future AI data integration and complex relationship modeling.
    *   **Redis** will be used for caching frequently accessed data, ensuring a snappy user experience, especially when fetching complex analytical results.
    *   **AWS services (ECS/EKS, RDS, S3, SageMaker)** provide the managed, scalable cloud infrastructure needed to deploy and operate these data-intensive services reliably.
*   **Intuitive User Experience:** A seamless and engaging user interface is crucial for consistent logging and data exploration.
    *   **React Native** enables us to build a high-quality, cross-platform mobile application with a consistent look and feel across iOS and Android. This accelerates development and ensures accessibility for a wider user base, directly addressing the need for an intuitive logging experience. The component-based architecture facilitates the creation of sophisticated data visualizations and interactive elements required for presenting complex nutritional information.

In summary, our technology stack is meticulously chosen to deliver NutriSense's unique value proposition: unparalleled accuracy in micronutrient tracking, sophisticated AI-driven insights connecting diet to holistic well-being, and an intuitive user experience that empowers users to achieve their health goals.

        *   `src/`: The source code for the React Native app.
            *   `assets/`: Static assets like images and fonts.
            *   `components/`: Reusable UI components.
            *   `navigation/`: Application navigation structure.
            *   `screens/`: Individual screens of the application.
            *   `services/`: API client and data fetching logic.
            *   `store/`: State management implementation.
            *   `types/`: TypeScript type definitions.
            *   `utils/`: General utility functions.
        *   `babel.config.js`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`: Frontend build and dependency configurations.
    *   `shared/`: Contains cross-cutting concerns or shared resources.
